My name is Michaël Lambé and I am a data engineer and software engineer at 
Goodyear Tires S.A. I love making beautiful charts, the statistical programming 
language R, beautiful code in general and all the topics related to cloud automation,
data pipeline and analytics. I enjoy programming in various language but my interest
is targeted to R, python, scala & Julia.

Data science is a fascinating area of study full of questions that seem simple 
but quickly unfold to reveal themselves as truly challenging problems. The study
of data science has been profoundly important in both my professional and personal
life for quite some time. I created this blog as a medium to help people understand
what makes data science theory (and practice!) both immensely important in how 
we understand the world as well as delight to study in its own right.

This blog is not strictly targeting a specific technology or 
methodology. Posts here will explore issues in Data Science and Data Engineering 
in general.
