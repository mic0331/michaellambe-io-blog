Data science is a fascinating area of study full of questions that seem simple 
but quickly unfold to reveal themselves as truly challenging problems. The study
of data science has been profoundly important in both my professional and personal
life for quite some time. I created this blog as a medium to help people understand
what makes data science theory both immensely important in how we understand the 
world as well as delight to study in its own right.

Despite the name, this blog is not a strictly Rstats blog. Posts here will
explore issues in Data Science and Data Engineering in general. We will explore 
various concepts & technologies to support our data science journey.

Thanks for reading!
